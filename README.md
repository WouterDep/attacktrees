# Attack Tree Generation and Evaluation for CPS
JavaFX tool for Attack Tree generation and evaluation for CPS systems. First a system model is moduled in *SysML*, which is then parsed to the *IDP* format using the *FAST-CPS* framework. The output of this framework, i.e. the system model and vulnerabilities, forms the input of this tool. An example input file is provided on this repository: *inputfile.idp*.
